# ✅ Admin Team Page - FIXED!

## 🔧 What Was Wrong

The **Admin Team Page** (`/admin/team`) was showing a **"SYSTEM ENCOUNTERED A SETBACK"** error because:

1. ❌ Trying to fetch from non-existent `/api/team` endpoint
2. ❌ Trying to fetch from non-existent `/api/tasks` endpoint
3. ❌ Accessing `member.firstName[0]` without checking if it exists
4. ❌ Accessing `member.assignedTasks.length` without null checks
5. ❌ No error handling for missing data

This caused the entire page to crash and show the error screen.

---

## ✅ What Has Been Fixed

### 1. **Fixed API Endpoints**
**Before:**
```typescript
const res = await fetch('/api/team', { ... })  // ❌ Doesn't exist
```

**After:**
```typescript
const res = await fetch('/api/admin/users', { ... })  // ✅ Exists
const teamMembers = data.users.filter(u => 
    u.role === 'REPORTER' || u.role === 'ADMIN'
)
```

### 2. **Added Safe Navigation**
**Before:**
```typescript
{member.firstName[0]}{member.lastName[0]}  // ❌ Crashes if undefined
```

**After:**
```typescript
{(member.firstName?.[0] || member.email?.[0] || '?').toUpperCase()}
{(member.lastName?.[0] || '').toUpperCase()}
```

### 3. **Added Default Values**
**Before:**
```typescript
{member.assignedTasks.length}  // ❌ Crashes if undefined
```

**After:**
```typescript
{(member.assignedTasks || []).length}  // ✅ Safe default
```

### 4. **Added Empty State**
Now shows a friendly message when no team members exist:
```tsx
<div className="p-20 text-center">
    <User className="h-16 w-16 text-gray-200 mx-auto mb-6" />
    <p>No Team Members</p>
    <p>Team members will appear here once registered</p>
</div>
```

### 5. **Improved Error Handling**
```typescript
try {
    // ... fetch logic
} catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to fetch team:', error)
    setTeam([])  // Set empty array instead of crashing
}
```
